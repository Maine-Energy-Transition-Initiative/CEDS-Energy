## Goals of the Program 

The goals of the program is to improve 10 buildings on the Great Cranberry Island

# 10 Steps to home improvements   

**1. EPA WaterSense showerheads**  Energy savings of 5-10%

-   A 1.5GPM showerhead uses 40% less water and thus 40% less energy to heat the water.

-   A typical family will save 10,000 gallons/year of hot water with low-flow showerheads. 

**2. LED light bulbs** Energy savings of 5-10%

-   LEDs use 85% less energy than incandescent bulbs, and reduce monthly energy costs by \$20-30 for an average home. 

**3. Window Dressers** Energy savings of 5-10%

-   Insulated window inserts improve indoor comfort and energy efficiency for less than 1/10th the cost of replacing windows. [www.windowdressers.org](http://www.windowdressers.org) 

**4. Heat pump water heater** **(HPWH)** Energy savings of 10-20%

-   Use 70% less energy than a standard electric water heater.

-   Significant rebates available through Efficiency Maine that increase their affordability.

-   Side benefit of helping dehumidify the space they’re in, like a damp basement.

**5. Electric appliances** Energy savings of up to 10%

-   Measure your refrigerator’s energy use and upgrade to an EnergyStar model as needed. 

-   Replace gas cooking equipment with induction or electric for health and safety.

**6. Energy audit** Health and Safety

-   Have a comprehensive audit to assess air leakage and insulation needs for your home.

-   Measures energy use, identifies opportunities for improvements, and identifies moisture problems or health and safety needs like ventilation and mold remediation. 

**7a. Basement/crawl space** Energy savings of 10-30%

-   Sealing the basement or crawlspace blocks rodents and heat loss.

-   Vapor barrier prevents ground moisture from getting into the house - reducing mold.

-   We recommend 3” of spray foam (R-21) from floor up over the rim joist to air seal and retain heat. This is an incredible improvement for fieldstone foundations. 

-   Make sure the contractor uses HFO/5th generation/low-Global Warming Potential spray foam. Older HFC blowing agents have 500x the carbon emissions!

**7b. Attic and wall air sealing and insulation** Energy savings of 10-25%

-   Because warm air rises, a significant portion of heat loss is through the attic. 

-   Air sealing first ensures that insulation works properly.

-   We recommend 18-24” of cellulose insulation to achieve R60-R80 in attics.

**8. Air source heat pumps** Energy savings of 10-40%

-   Provide winter heating and summer cooling and dehumidification for your home.

-   Work in temperatures as low as -15F, and can be the sole source of heat if your home is well insulated.

**9. Electric Vehicle**

-   A 2020 study by Consumer Reports found that the lifetime ownership costs were significantly lower for EVs. Most EVs saved between \$6,000 - \$10,000 over their lifetimes.

**10. Solar** Energy production up to 100%

-   Install rooftop solar to supply all your electricity needs.

-   30% federal tax credit and financing options are available.

-   Battery backup is needed for solar to work during a power outage
