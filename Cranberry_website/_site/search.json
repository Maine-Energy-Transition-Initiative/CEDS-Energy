    "text": "Maine Energy Retrofits for Community Improvements (MERCI)\nIs your home drafty and expensive to heat in the winter? Hot in the summer? Is there too much moisture or have rodents moved in? If you answered yes to any of these questions, we’d like to help!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur team can perform a free home energy assessment, giving you an objective look at your home’s construction and energy systems. Then, we will make several recommendations for improving your home’s comfort, efficiency, and safety and share information about available rebates and tax credits to help pay for upgrades. If you choose to implement any of the recommendations, we can help coordinate contractors and arrange for lower rates by bundling upgrades with your neighbors.\n\n\n\nInsulating an attic using a cellulose blower\n\n\n\nWe look forward to helping you make your house more comfortable and efficient while reducing your community’s fossil fuel use!"

    "text": "As a pilot program, we are starting our services with the Great Cranberry Island community. While the proximity to the ocean gives stunning views from many of the homes on the island, it also means higher winds, making homes harder to fully insulate from the elements. In addition, the relatively isolated nature of the island makes it difficult to organize contractors to complete repairs and upgrades, making our coordination and support even more valuable to the community.\n\nCommunities and Contractors\nBelow is the list of communities that we are both currently supporting and have plans in place to provide support for in the future.\nGreat Cranberry Island\nIslesford\nPleasant Point\nAdditional information about the contractors we commonly work with can be found below:\nEfficiency Maine: Rebates and support\nEfficiency Maine’s website has additional information on federal tax credits and energy rebates available in Maine. They are a great source for finding a contractor in your area to help with any of these improvements: www.efficiencymaine.com/at-home/ \nRS Insulation: https://rsinsulationinc.com/\nTwin City Heat Pumps: https://www.twincityheatpumps.com/ \nWindow Dressers: www.windowdressers.org \n\nBoth of these lists will be updated as the project develops!"

    "text": "The Community Energy Center at College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor recently received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to make home energy improvements more accessible in Downeast Maine. Our process begins with an in-depth assessment of a home to identify the most cost-effective upgrades to improve comfort and energy efficiency. For homeowners who want to make upgrades, the team can coordinate with contractors to reduce hassle and costs. \nIn addition to the assessment team, we have a data science team that can quantitatively analyze the benefits provided by the installed upgrades. For a limited number of homeowners, the data science team can also measure air quality contaminants using wifi-enabled monitors and conduct before and after monitoring of energy upgrades.\n\n\n\nThe Community Energy Center at College of the Atlantic"
