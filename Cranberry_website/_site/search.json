    "text": "Maine Energy Retrofits for Community Improvements (MERCI)\nWelcome! We are a government-funded program committed to providing free high-quality energy audits and catalyze low-cost energy improvements to Maine homeowners.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose to work with us, we will provide you with a free comprehensive energy audit, giving you an objective look at your home’s energy systems. Then, we will provide several options for improving your home’s efficiency, and negotiate with contractors on your behalf to integrate the solutions you choose.\n\n\n\nA worker insulating an attic using a cellulose blower\n\n\nThroughout this process, we will consider all available options and ensure you gain the most benefit for the lowest cost available, both through government rebates and community-wide benefits.\n\nWe look forward to aiding you in the process of making your community less dependent on fossil fuels!"

    "text": "As a pilot program, we are starting our services with the Great Cranberry Island community, of around 40 year-round families (increasing to 100 in the summer). While the proximity to the ocean gives stunning views from many of the homes on the island, it also means higher winds, making homes harder to fully insulate from the elements. In addition, the relatively isolated nature of the island makes it difficult to organize contractors to complete repairs and upgrades, making our coordination and support even more valuable to the community.\n\nCommunities and Contractors\nBelow is the list of communities that we are both currently supporting and have plans in place to provide support for in the future.\nGreat Cranberry Island\nIslesford\nPleasant Point\nAdditional information about the contractors we commonly work with can be found below:\nEfficiency Maine: Rebates and support\nEfficiency Maine’s website has additional information on federal tax credits and energy rebates available in Maine. They are a great source for finding a contractor in your area to help with any of these improvements: www.efficiencymaine.com/at-home/ \n\nBoth of these lists will be updated as the project develops!"

    "text": "Local background\nMaine is the most heating oil dependent state in the country, with 58% of homes using fuel oil as the primary source of heat. In recent years, we have spent more than $4 billion annually on fossil fuels, resulting in more than 6% of the state’s GDP being spent on energy imports. In the last two years, heating oil and kerosene prices doubled from $2-$3/gallon to $5-6/gallon, and stayed above $4/gallon for the entire year from March 2022 to 2023. At the same time, Maine’s electricity prices increased significantly, causing already high household energy burdens to nearly double in the last two years.\nTo compound this issue, Maine has some of the oldest houses in the nation, meaning many homes are poorly or entirely uninsulated. 56% of the houses in Maine were built before 1980, and most of the homes built since then are not well insulated either. Maine has enacted a statewide Climate Action Plan to counteract and correct this issue, but it has encountered significant workforce shortages, particularly in the energy efficiency and weatherization sector. As such, the state has identified doubling the energy efficiency workforce as a priority for reaching clean energy goals, hiring more workers and issuing grants for energy improvement projects.\n\n\n\nThe Community Energy Center at College of the Atlantic\n\n\n\n\nThis program\nThe energy team at College of the Atlantic, headed by David Gibson, recently received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy Building Technologies Office to fund a program making home energy improvements more accessible to coastal Maine homeowners. Participating households will receive upgrades to critical areas of their homes, such as heating and cooling systems, lighting, insulation, and air sealing, in addition to potential solar arrays. The upgrade process begins with an in-depth audit of the current systems installed in groups of 10 or more buildings, and identifying the upgrades that would provide the most benefit in comfort and energy efficiency. From there, the team will coordinate with contractors on the behalf of the homeowners to install these measures.\nIn addition to the team organizing energy upgrades, this project also involves a data science team to quantitatively analyze the benefit provided by the installed upgrades using temperature and heating load data. The team will also analyze data collected from the Arduino air quality monitors installed in consenting households, both to visualize the effectiveness of the energy upgrades and to identify potential air quality risks to be corrected.\n\nReferences:\n\nEIA. https://www.eia.gov/state/data.php?sid=ME#ConsumptionExpenditures.
