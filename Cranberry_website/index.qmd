If you choose to work with us, we will provide you with a free comprehensive energy audit, giving you an objective look at your home's energy systems. Then, we will provide several options for improving your home's efficiency, and negotiate with contractors on your behalf to integrate the solutions you choose.

Throughout this process, we will consider all available options and ensure you gain the most benefit for the lowest cost available, both through government rebates and community-wide benefits.

### We look forward to aiding you in the process of making your community less dependent on fossil fuels!
