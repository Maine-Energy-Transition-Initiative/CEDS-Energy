# Home Energy Improvement Case Studies

## Cottage

![](Images/cottage.jpeg)

The Cottage house was built in 1880 and the residents over the years have complained of moisture issues and insufficient heating and cooling. The school also didn't like the cost of the heating oil deliveries or that it it was dependent on fossil fuels. After doing a comprehensive energy audit it was determined to need two heat pumps (one on each floor) and a heat pump water heater. As well as the basement needing a vapor barrier and insulation.

Before the energy improvements were made the total amount of energy the house was using was high
