## Summary of your Audit

### Visual Inspection and Measurements

We started with a tour and visual inspection of the inside and outside of the home. We identified any visible damage to the building, moisture control strategies, major appliances, and insulation. We measured square footage and volume of the home, as well as the area of all exterior windows and doors. We used a kill-a-watt meter to measure the electricity use of some appliances. During your audit, we used a carbon monoxide meter to measure the ambient carbon monoxide levels throughout the home.

### Attic

We entered the attic to check for insulation, air sealing, ventilation, and potential hazards such as mold. Additionally, we visually inspected the attic ventilation and any duct and pipework passing through the attic.

### Basement

We visually inspected any appliances in the basement and noted insulation levels, moisture, rodents, and any other concerns.

### Blower Door / Air Leakage Test

A blower door test measures the air tightness of a building. We used a specialized fan in an exterior door to generate negative pressure inside your house. The resulting pressure difference between the inside and outside of the house allows us to measure air leakage. To locate the leaks, we used an infrared camera to check for unusually hot and cold spots. We also checked the pressure differences of the rooms to help determine major air leak locations.

A blower door test simulates a 20mph wind hitting your house from all sides.

To run the test, we used a large fan in an exterior door to depressurize your house. As air is pulled out through the fan, an equal volume of air is pulled in through all of the gaps, cracks, and air leaks throughout the house. This allows us to determine the volume of air leakage into the house and to locate bigger air leaks. 

To find leaks, we used an infrared camera to check for unusually hot and cold spots. We also checked the pressure differences of the rooms to help determine major air leak locations.

Air leaks are a big source of heat gain in warm weather and heat loss in cold weather. They also allow moisture to get into the home. Below are some numbers, pictures, and descriptions explaining what we found.

*Problem*

Your shower heads use more water and energy than high-efficiency shower heads, thus costing you more money than necessary. Older shower heads use 2.5 gallons or more every minute, which wastes thousands of gallons of water each year and costs you money for every extra gallon of water heated. 

*Recommendation*

Install high-efficiency shower heads to reduce the amount of water and energy to heat the water used when showering. We recommend 1.5 gallon per minute shower heads that will save a gallon or more of water for every minute spent in the shower.

*Estimated Costs/Benefits/Incentives*

A typical family will save ~10,000 gallons of water per year and over $100 per year in water heating costs. We provide these for free and have several styles for you to choose from; contact us for some if we did not give you any during the audit.

*Problem*

Your windows are a source of heat loss, reduce your comfort due to cold surface temperatures, and may also cause moisture condensation or frost in the winter. 

*Recommendation*
WindowDressers insulating window inserts help air-seal windows and reduce heat loss and gain. There will be a WindowDresser community build on Great Cranberry Island from November 9th through 14th. Sign up at https://windowdressers.org/sign-up-for-inserts/ There will be a WindowDressers community build in Eastport from November 18th through 25th. Contact Pete to sign up: 207-214-4751 or EastportMEEnergy@gmail.com
WindowDressers are transparent and let in light while stopping drafts. Each insert is made of a custom-made pine frame wrapped on each side with tightly sealed, clear polyolefin film, creating an airspace between the two layers for additional insulation. The insert is finished with a compressible foam weather seal. The foam allows enough give for the inserts to be easily slid into place in the fall and removed in the spring while holding firmly enough to provide a tight, friction-based seal. The inserts are installed inside your existing window frame with no fasteners required and last 5-10 years. They are most effective in the winter, but depending on the window's exposure, they can sometimes be used in the summer to keep the house cooler.

*Estimated Costs/Benefits/Incentives*

Insulating window inserts save 5-10% of your heating costs at less than 1/10th the cost of replacement windows. The overall project cost will depend on the number and size of window inserts. Example prices for 2024: small (20 x 36”) - $36 for natural pine frame, $46 for white; medium (30 x 52”) - $50 for natural pine frame, $64 for white; large (44 x 68”) - $67 for natural pine frame, $88 for white. Adjusted pricing for lower-income households is available from WindowDressers upon request. If plastic is damaged, it can be replaced for $15. 
Households that order inserts are expected to participate in the Community Build where the inserts are made. You can sign up for a 4-hour shift and learn the simple steps in the insert-building process (no previous experience required, no power tools). Each job has “jigs” that make the job easier to do and ensure uniform quality. You will be trained at the beginning of your shift on how to do your task. Volunteering for multiple shifts is encouraged! Mid-shift snacks and a meal are provided to all participants.
If you would like to participate, please contact us so we can discuss how the program works and which windows you’d like inserts for.

Your gas range has the potential to release propane, carbon monoxide, and combustion gases into your house. Gas ranges are also inefficient at transferring heat to your food at 32% efficiency, compared to 85% efficiency for induction cooktops. 

*Recommendation*

Induction cooking appliances are more efficient and safer than electric or gas ones. There is no risk of carbon monoxide or other harmful combustion gases, and the surface doesn’t heat up without a pot or pan on it.

*Estimated Costs/Benefits/Incentives*

Currently, Efficiency Maine does not offer a rebate for induction stoves. If you’re interested in trying out induction cooking but don’t want to replace your kitchen stove, consider buying a portable induction cooktop, which costs less than $100.

*Problem*

** Auditor to describe depending on what their current system is. 

*Recommendation*

Install a heat pump water heater to provide your hot water for cooking and bathing. This is the most efficient way to heat water and will save hundreds of dollars a year compared to electric resistance, heating oil or propane hot water. It will also help to dehumidify while it's running. If your current water heater burns oil or propane, this will also remove a source of combustion gases from your house. We also recommend setting the temperature on the water heater at 130°F for more efficient operation.

*Estimated Costs/Benefits/Incentives*

A heat pump water heater uses 70% less electricity than a standard electric water heater. Depending on your income, Efficiency Maine offers a no-cost program for low-income households, or a rebate of up to $1,000 for everyone else, making the equipment cost as little as $400 plus installation. The rebate can be combined with a federal tax credit of 30% of the remaining cost. For more information, you can call Efficiency Maine at 866-376-2463 (Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm) or visit their website: https://www.efficiencymaine.com/at-home/heat-pump-water-heater-program/

*Problem*

There is excess moisture in the basement/crawlspace, which is evaporating out of the ground. This moisture can enter the house and cause mold, mildew, rot, and air quality issues.

*Recommendation*

Install a vapor barrier on the basement floor to stop moisture from entering the basement and house. Vapor barriers typically consist of either reinforced plastic sheeting or EPDM rubber membrane over a ‘dimple mat’ that allows for drainage below the vapor barrier and prevents rocks from puncturing it. If the basement/crawlspace walls are going to be spray foamed, we recommend the foam go all the way to the floor and overlap the vapor barrier to create a continuous air and moisture barrier. 

*Estimated Costs/Benefits/Incentives*

Efficiency Maine rebates will cover vapor barriers up to 25% of a weatherization project cost, if done as part of a larger insulation project. Efficiency Maine rebates and other incentives for insulation work can fund up to 80% of the project cost, up to $9,200 when combined with federal tax credits.

*Problem*

The basement/crawlspace is uninsulated and used for mechanical equipment and plumbing. The walls are porous and allow moisture into the house and rapidly conduct heat out of the space. 

*Recommendation*

Install spray foam on the basement/crawlspace walls to prevent moisture infiltration and reduce heat loss. In older homes, most heat loss is due to air leakage. Air sealing is particularly important in the basement or crawlspace (and attic). As warm air rises and leaks out the top of your home, cold air is pulled in at the bottom. This is called the ‘stack effect’, and is more pronounced in taller homes. Thus, air sealing is necessary anywhere gaps allow air to move into your house through the basement/crawlspace.
Spray foam should be applied 2-3 inches thick on the walls to seal and insulate them. It is often ideal to install a vapor barrier at the same time as the spray foam insulation. Spray foam generally requires a layer of intumescent (fire-rated) paint over it to meet fire code.

*Estimated Costs/Benefits/Incentives*

Installation of spray foam insulation will cost around $5-7 per square foot.
